# HIMANSHI_Team_Kalpana

This is a Python program that reads a CSV file and displays it in the terminal using the curses library. The user can scroll through the data using the arrow keys and quit the program by pressing 'q'.

The program can handle large CSV files that don't fit in the terminal window by using a scrollable pad.
The program automatically adjusts to changes in the terminal window size.
